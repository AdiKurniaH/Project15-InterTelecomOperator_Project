# Interconnection Telecommunications Project
Interconnection telecommunications operators want to be able to predict their clients' movements. If it is discovered that a user is planning to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special plan options. Interconnection's marketing team has collected some of their clients' personal data, including information about their plans and contracts.

## Objective 
- Create several models and compare the models.
- Compare the monthly payment distribution (*MonthlyCharges*) of all active clients with clients who have left. 
- Calculate the following statistics for each group: 
  - average value 
  - minimum
  - maximum
  - median
  - 25% and 75% percentile values. 
- Build a distribution histogram based on existing findings.
- Compare the behavior of clients from the two groups below. For each group, create two graphs showing:
  - Share of telephone users
  - Share of Internet users

## Project Notes
The main metric used in the model is AUC-ROC, while the supporting metric is the Accuracy score metric.
